<Body>
    Your <poetry> sonnet </poetry> is quite <feeling type="pleasure">lovely </feeling>, and it is a marvel that those <description> red-roseleaf </description> lips of yours should be made no less for the <emotion> madness </emotion> of music and song than for the <emotion> madness </emotion> of kissing. 
    Your <description type="body"> slim </description> gilt soul walks between passion and poetry. 
    I know <allusion type="GreekMythology"> Hyacinthus </allusion>, whom <allusion type="GreekMythology"> Apollo </allusion> loved so madly, was you in Greek days.
    Why are you alone in <location type="England"> London </location>, and when do you go to <location type="England">Salisbury </location>? 
    Do go there to cool your hands in the <description type="color">grey </description> twilight of <Literature type="genre"> Gothic </Literature> things, and come here whenever you like. 
    It is a <description type="postive"> lovely </description> place and lacks only you; but go to <location type="England"> Salisbury </location> first.
